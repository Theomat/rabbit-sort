    <h4>Game Rules</h4>
    <p>
        The goal of this game is to sort both the hat and rabbit tokens from left to right in ascending order.
        Both hats and rabbits tokens are numbered from 1 to 9. <br>
        You will only see 9 stacks, hat tokens are stacked over rabbit tokens, so you cannot see the number on the rabbit tokens.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        You have 2 minutes and 3 actions in order to sort them:
        <li>
            <ul>"Peeking" shows you the rabbit token underneath the hat token.</ul>
            <ul>"Swapping hats" swaps the hats of two stacks.</ul>
            <ul>"Swapping all" swaps the hats and rabbits tokens of two stacks.</ul>
        </li>
    
        You can use the number keys to directly select the stack with the hat token whose number match the one pressed.
    </p>
    <h4>Difficulty</h4>
    <p>
        Difficulty up to level 4 add one lock per level, a locked stack cannot be selected for any action.<br>
        Difficulty level 5 add a random swap of stacks every 3 moves but removes all locks.<br>
        Difficulty after level 5 add one lock per level up to 3.<br>
        And the last two difficulty level each remove 30 seconds.
    </p>
    <h4>Note on random swaps</h4>
    <p>
        Since random swaps with locks can be very hard to sort because of bad luck, once the hat tokens and rabbit tokens are correctly paired, swaps no longer occur.
